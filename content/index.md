# About Me

I’m Lasse, a researcher/engineer with a passion for making complex systems move. My background blends hands-on work in space systems and robotics with a deep curiosity for control theory and mathematical optimization. After work, you’ll likely find me tinkering with synthesizers, reading, or busy with some woodworking/DIY project. This blog is a space to document (unfinished) ideas, hobby projects, and whatever else I find worth sharing.
